## ts-react-express

A simple boilerplate 'full stack' application using React, express and typescript. 

The 2 most important aspects of this application are:
1. Webpack is used for BOTH client-side AND server-side builds.
2. During development, BOTH client-side AND server-side code will reload automatically.  

To run in development mode: 

`npm run dev` 

(or `npm run prepare:dev` and `npm run start:dev`)
