## ts-react-express

A simple boilerplate 'full stack' application using React, express and typescript.

2. During development, BOTH client-side AND server-side code will reload automatically.  

To run in development mode: 

1. `npm run prepare:dev`
2. `npm run start:dev`
3. [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html)
